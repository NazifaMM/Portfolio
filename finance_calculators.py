Pseudo code 

User input - prompt user to determine which calculation they would like to use (investment or bond).
Convert the user input into lowercase, so that code can recognise the word regardless of capitising.

Determine if the user wants to use investement, by users input.
    
    Determine the parameters used for the investment calcultion, by prompting user for input.
             
             if the user wants to use simple interest.
             Calculate the simple interest.
             Print the Result.
             
             else if the user wants to use compound interest.
             Calculate the compound interest.
             Print the Result.

Determine else if the user wants to use the bond repayment calculator, by userss input.

    Detremine the paramters used for the bond repayment calculation, by prompting user for input.
    Calculate the bond repayment.
    Print out the results.

Else if the user input is invalid 
     Print out error message
